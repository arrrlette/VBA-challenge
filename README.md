VBA Project

The purpose of this project was to create a VBA script that loops through al the stocks provided in the dataset for one year and outputs the following information:

The ticker symbol.
Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The total stock volume of the stock.

Condiitional formatting was also applied that highlights positive changes in green and negative in red.

We were provided with two sets of data: test data that was used while developing the script, and stock data which was used to generate the final report.

The script also returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 

The script was adjusted so that it would run on every worksheet just by running the VBA script once.
